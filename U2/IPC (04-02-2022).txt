general :

- inter process communication
- computer networks share data, resources & computation speed

- process :

	- independent process

	- cooperating process

		- info sharing
		- computation speed up
		- modularity
		- convenience 

- inter process communication (IPC) :

	- message passing model

		- process A + process B + ... + message queue + m1m2m3m4...mn + kernel
		
- producer/consumer problem :

	- write()/read() pairing
	- shared bounded buffer implemented as circular array with in & out

- shared memory : used among processes that need to communicate
