test & set algorithm :

- satisfies critical section requirements

- do

	waiting[i] = true
	key = true

	while(waiting[i] && key)

		key = test_and_set(&lock)

	waiting[i] = false
	
	<critical section>

	j = (i+1)%n

	while((j != i) && !waiting[j])

		j = (j+1)%n

	if (j==1) lock = false
	else waiting[j] = false

	<remainder section>

  while (true)

- essentially, only the processes to be entered are given true lock status while the rest are given false so they don't go into critical section
