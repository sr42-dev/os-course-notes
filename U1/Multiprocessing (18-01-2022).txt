multiprocessors :

- multiprocessors : multiple cores
- parallel systems possible
- increased throughput, economy of scale & reliability

- two types :

	- asymmetric multiprocessing : processes are executed by one core at a time (master/slave system)
	- symmetric multiprocessing : process load is shared by all cores
		- main memory is shared by all cores/CPUs
		- e.g.; dual core processor

blade servers :

- processor, io board etc integrated in a single chassis

storage area network :

- storage sharing between multiple processors (analog to multiple cores)
- survives failures by clustering
