general :

- multiprogramming : bringing more processes to the RAM for execution
- multitasking : using more CPUs to perform more executions at the same time
- hardware & software interrupt
- dual mode : user mode & kernel mode determined by mode bit
- kernel is the intermediate between OS & hardware
- mode bit is changed by interrupt, which sends the OS into kernel mode, which can reset the system
- dual & multimode operation
- timers are implemented using clock signal to trigger interrupt infinite loops
