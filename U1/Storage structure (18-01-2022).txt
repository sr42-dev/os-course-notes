hard disk :

- non volatile memory extension
- multiple metal/glass discs divided into tracks -> sectors
- disk controller determines interactions between device & computer
- solid state disks : faster, compact, high memory density

storage/memory heirarchy : 

- registry -> cache -> main memory -> ssd -> hard disk -> optical disk -> magnetic tape
- level 0 to 6
- increase in level decreases speed
- increase in level increases size
- increase in level decreases cost/unit memory

cache :

- cache : virtual memory, used for copying information into a faster storage level
- e.g.; main memory is a cache for secondary storage
- when data is accessed, cache is checked first
- if cache is smaller than storage being cached : design problem
- fixed by replacement policy : FIFO -> first unused process loaded into cache is removed and replaced by new process
