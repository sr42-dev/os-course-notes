linux 2.5 :

- currently v5.16 
- old case study

- cfs scheduler :

	- scheduling classes
	- classes were fixed for execution based on priority
	- completely fair scheduler
	- assigns proportion of cpu time to each task
	- nice value
	- virtual run time based BST is used to represent
	- BST has time complexity of logn
	- red/black tree type is used as it is self balancing
	
- real time scheduling according to posix 1.b
- real time tasks have static priorities

windows :

- priority based preemptive scheduling
