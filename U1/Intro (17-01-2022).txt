introduction :

- 10/40/50 for programming exercises/ISA/ESA
- resources : io devices, memory, processor (HW)
- shareable/non-shareable resources
- os manages resources
- system & application software e.g.; (os,bios, compiler), editors, etc
- provides a user friendly environment for computer use e.g.; unix, linux, windows, macos
- user + system perspective (latter -> focus)

- why study? : to potimize programs for performance & security
- user (level 1) -> programs (level 2) -> os (level 3) -> hardware (level 4)
- user may be person or another computer
- os is a resource allocator & control program from system pov
- kernel runs at all times on the computer

OS goals :

- user friendliness
- program execution efficiency
- efficient hardware use (optimization)
- manage resources (memory, processor, i/o)
