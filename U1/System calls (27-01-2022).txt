general :

- exit()
- wait()
- waitpid()
- waitid()

- exec() // check sample programs

	- execv()
	- execl()
	- execle()
	- execve()
	- execlp()
	- execvp()
	- fexecve()

- getpid()
- getppid()

race condition :

- when two processes are trying to run at the same time but resources are allocated based on order of execution
- mutual exclusion

CPU scheduling :

- only one process per CPU
- solved by multi core processors
- eneabled by multiprogramming
- alternating CPU/IO burst

scheduling criteria :

- CPU utilization
- throughput
- turnaround time
- waiting time
- response time
- <FCFS & SJF waiting time reduction methods>
