short term scheduler :

- invoked frequently (in ms)
- selects processes to be executed from RAM

long term scheduling :

- brings processes from hard drive to CPU
- invoked infrequently (every few minutes)
- controls degree of multiprogramming

medium term scheduler :

- swaps processes between memory, disk & CPU
- aka swapper

context switch :

- saving state of old PCB when new process is loaded
- context in PCB
- complex CPU makes context switches slower

system processes :

- created by fork()
- fork doesn't take any arguments and returns int (0 for child, +ve for parent, -ve for error)
- in C, they exist in sys/types.h & unistd.h
- fork() splits process into child and parent process
- hence, two fork() calls will split parent -> child1 + parent followed by splitting child1 into child1 & child2 and parent into child1 & parent (all children are main() calls)
- n forks call main() 2^n - 1 times (as forking is structured like a binary tree and one leaf will always be the parent)
- resources allocated to parent is also shared by children

- if child process executes and parent is in sleep/exited : zombie
- if a parent is terminated without wait, process is an orphan

preemptive & non-preemtive scheduling :

- preemptive :

	- fcfs
	- sjf
	- priority

- non premptive :

	- round robin
	- shortest remaining time
	- multilevel queue
	- multilevel feedback queue

- dispatcher gives control of module to CPU as selected by short term scheduler

- GANTT chart analysis :

	- used to represent queue of tasks
	- turnaround time = completion time - arrival time
	- waiting time = turnaround time -  first time

	- arrival time : time at tasking
	- burst time : execution time
	- gantt chart axis represents arrival time
	- each task is as large as represented by it's burst time
	- new tasks may arrive before the previous one is done executing, in which case, burst time is added to arrival time for a task
	- completion time = start time + burst time
	- turnaround time = completion time - arrival time
	- waiting time = turnaround time - burst time

general :

- multilevel queue scheduling
- multilevel feedback scheduling

multi-processor scheduling :

- load balancing :

	- push migration
	- pull migration
