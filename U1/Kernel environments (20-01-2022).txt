general :

-  array : contiguous static data structure

- linked lists : used in secondary memory 

	- easy insertion & deletion
	- O(n) time complexity
	- used to construct stacks & queues

- stacks : used in compilers, bracket matching, LIFO
- queues : used in printer queues, FIFO

- trees : heirarchical data structure

	- parent/child format
	- O(n) for binary, O(log n) for BST
	- used in CPU scheduling

- hash tables : 

	- O(1) time complexity
	- key-value pair format 

- bitmaps :

	- string of n binary digits denoting states of n items
	- 0/1 : resource available/unavailable
	- used to denote availability of disk blocks

- portals : web access to internal systems
- distributed computing
- network operating system

- client/server architecture :
	
	- servers facilitate data access (file server) & provide an interface to request services (compute server)
	- clients request services from the server

- virtualization : OS natively compiled for CPU (type 1 - no host OS between hypervisor & hardware, type 2 - host OS present)
- emulation : when source CPU different from target in virtualization
- hypervisors help virtual machines to connect to hardware resources

- cloud computing :
	
	- availibility of computer resources  like data storage and computing power without direct active management by the user
	- software as a service e.g.; word processors
	- platform as a service e.g.; Azure
	- infrastructure as a service e.g.; AWS
