general :

-  3 user interfaces : GUI, batch & command line

- system calls are made from user interfaces : 

	- prog exec
	- io ops
	- file systems
	- communication
	- resource alloc
	- accounting (resource sharing)
	- error detection

- batch code
- communications between programs
-  protection & security
- system calls are written in C & C++ (usually) as subroutines :

	- process control
	- file manip
	- device manip
	- information maintenance
	- comms
	- protection

design :

- define specs
- note choice of hardware
- systems are written in C/C++, scripting in python/perl
- higher level languages port easily but are slower
